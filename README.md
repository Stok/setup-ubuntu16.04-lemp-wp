# setup-ubuntu16.04-lemp-wp

To install LEMP and Wordpress on ubuntu 16.04, run `bash ./install_lemp_and_wordpress.sh`.

This is a script for running a series of other scripts (https://github.com/Stok/setup-ubuntu16.04-lemp.git for LEMP and https://github.com/Stok/setup-ubuntu16.04-wordpress.git for WP). Basically just clones the two git repos and runs them.

While installing LEMP, you'll be asked to set the root pw for the SQL database.
This same pw will be required when creating the wordpress db.
