# setup-ubuntu16.04-lemp-wp
a script for running install scripts for LEMP (https://github.com/Stok/setup-ubuntu16.04-lemp.git) and WP (https://github.com/Stok/setup-ubuntu16.04-wordpress.git). Basically just clones the two git repos and runs the main scripts.

While installing LEMP, you'll be asked to set the root pw for the SQL database.
This same pw will be required when creating the wordpress db.

To install LEMP and Wordpress on ubuntu 16.04, run `bash ./install_lemp_and_wordpress.sh`.
